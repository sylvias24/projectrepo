My First Project using Git

For my second assignment, I learn to use GIT Bash to create folder projectrepo
The assignment let me familiarize with various command that can be used in GIT as Version Control System
 The single > creates a file (or overwrites it if it exists)
 The double >> appends content to the end of the file without overwriting it 
when we use the echo command with redirection operators > or >> in Git Bash, the file is being saved automatically as soon as we press enter
